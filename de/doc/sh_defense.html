<h2>Defense of Stronghold</h2>

<p>
Does you clan want to reap the benefits of high-level Stronghold bonuses, but don't want to be a "feeder" for top clans? 
Or have you already had such negative experience?
</p>

<p>
Theoretically, there is a solution - join with other clans and cover each other's SH's by not letting enemies attack. 
However, everyone who has tried this knows about tons of issues with this strategy.
</p>

<p>
A clan panel's "Stronghold" will help solve most of these problems.
</p>

<p>
Each member of an alliance will get an individual list of tasks based <a href="{% url action_doc_page page='sh_clan_tasks' %}">on rules</a> that are very hard to compose manually. 
This is a dynamic, flexible list that automatically updates according to the activities of other alliance members.
</p>

<p>
The data are always up-to-date - if their age exceeds 10 minutes, they are automatically recalculated using the WG clan portal.
</p>

<p>
Alliance members can always check which clans can cover them on a particular day.
</p>

<p>
There are also tips about the time remaining until new attacks on alliance members and your own clan.
</p>

<p>
The alliance summary will automatically reveal "fat cats" who are not doing what they must to provide the much-needed cover for alliance members.
