<h2>Forming and supporting a clan company</h2>

<p>
This function is intended to help clan company commanders manage company composition, 
select appropriate setup of the vehicles for particular battles, 
pick company members by availability of a certain vehicle in their hangars and by playing skills they have on that vehicle.
</p>

<p>
<a href="{% url action_doc_page page='company_example' %}">Example of usage.</a>
</p>

<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>

<p>
It is free.
</p>

<p><strong>Where to start from?</strong></p>

<p>
If your clan isn't added to this service yet, you can add it using the submission form on the homepage and waiting for approval. Initial loading data for a clan may take few minutes, and depend on the current load on the server.
</p>

<p>
Then authorize via wargaming.net OpenID (the "Sign in" link above) and open the page of your clan in the service, clicking the clantag link, that appears in place of the "Sign in" link after you authorize.
</p>

<p>
If you are a member of the administration of your clan (a commander, a deputy commander, a recruiter, a field commander), the "Management" link will be available to you. 
Following this link you can see an empty table of clan's companies and the "New company" link above.
</p>

<p><strong>How to create a company?</strong></p>

<p>
Click the "New company" link. You should specify a tag and a name for your new company.
</p>

<p>
Tag is a unique id of your company in the clan, it is specified upon creation of the company and cannot be changed later. The tag must be one number or one Latin symbol.
</p>

<p>
Name is an arbitrary string that will be displayed in the company list. The name of a company can be changed later.
</p>

<p>
Put checkmarks in the leftmost column of the clan member list near the names of those people you would like to include into the new company and click the "Form a company" button below.
</p>

<p><strong>What are company setups and what are they for?</strong></p>

<p>
Company setup is a set of tanks you plan using in a battle. 
By creating a company setup you can review vehicles of a certain configuration company members have and evaluate their gaming skills on given machines from the setup.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after creating, a company has no setups. 
To create a company setup, click the "New setup" link from the company editor page.
You can use the company type dropdown list and vehicle level links to filter out the list of displayed vehicles. 
Name the setup (the name will be displayed in the setup table), select tank models for this setup, 
specify the number of tanks of each type and click the "Save" button in the bottom of the page.
</p>

</p>
This will open this company setup page. 
For each company member, if he has appropriate vehicles listed in the setup, the win percentage and the number of battles fought on the corresponding vehicle is shown.
</p>

<p>
You can create unlimited number of setups for a company - for various battle types, maps and so on.
</p>

<p><strong>What about non-absolute setups, say champion?</strong></p>

<p>
If you try to create a non-absolute setup for a company (for example, a champion setup) you'll find that no company members have tanks for such a setup. 
Nevertheless you do have machines in your garage that meet the setup. 
That is because the service automatically detects top vehicles members have, but for non-top tanks the owner of the account must notify the service explicitly.
</p>

<p>
This can be done as follows. Authorize in the service (see "Where to start from?"). In the upper part of the page you will see the "Your_nickname" link.
By following this link you will open your profile. There you can see the list of non-top tanks you played at least one battle on since clan data were updated last time.
Select tanks you currently possess in your garage and click the "Save settings" button.
</p>

<p>
Then, after you are back into the company editor, you will see data on your vehicles in the non-absolute setup of your account. 
If you want to have the complete information for non-absolute setups (which is especially important after "Seasons" was introduced on the CW), all members of your company must do the same. 
You can control which company members have selected their non-top tanks and who have not by looking to the "Profile" column in the company member table of the company editor. 
The cells of this table display the number of days since a player updated his profile.
</p>

<p>
If a player didn't save his profile yet, the corresponding cell is empty.
</p>

<p><strong>How to select combatants based on vehicle setups used by the company?</strong></p>

<p>
If a company member doesn't meet the requirements anymore for some reason, you can delete him from the list of company members. 
To do this, check his nickname in the leftmost column of the table and select the "Remove from company" in the dropdown list above the table and click "Execute".
</p>

<p>
If you are lack of combatants having certain skills or running certain vehicles for the company setup, open this setup's page and click the "Add members" link. 
A list of clan members who are not in your company yet and who have at least one tank from the current company setup will be shown. 
Columns of the table will display win rate and the number of battles on the corresponding machine.
</p>

<p>
In the left column mark all clan members that meet your criteria and click the "Add selected" button.
</p>


<p><strong>What is an stuff list of a setup and what is it for?</strong></p>

<p>
By analyzing vehicle possession, experience and skills of company members as part of a certain setup you as a field commander should decide what tank each company member should run. 
You can formalize your decisions as an stuff list of the setup. 
Put the checkmark in the corresponding cell of the member table of the selected setup and click the "Save members roles in setup" button.
</p>

<p>
The table "Stuff list" displays nicknames of players who should play the corresponding tanks of the setup, according to you. 
You do not have to assign a particular tank to the member in each setup, or you can assign several tanks for him in order for him to be able to replace some other member.
</p>

<p>
If the public section "Companies", the organization list will show in the table of company setups and will become available to all clan members. 
This information can be useful for company members to define priorities and to decide which tanks should be top-equipped (like premium ammunition, consumables, crew training etc.)
</p>


<p><strong>How can I be sure the information about my company won't be passed to rivals of our clan?</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>
All information gathered by the service is obtained from the public pages of the worldoftanks.eu portal and can be gathered regardless of whether you use this service or not. 
The data on setups you're using and distribution of members across vehicles is available to competitors teams on each battle.
</li>

<li>
The only significant information not available from other sources is data on non-top machines in hangars of members. 
If you believe this information can have some value for your rivals, you can stop using the above mentioned functions for non-absolute companies (champion etc.)
</li>

<li>
You can disable public access for your clan data by enabling the "Access to clan members only" option in the "Management" section (this function is only available in the paid modes).
</li>
