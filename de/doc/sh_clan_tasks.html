<h2>How the ally cover task list is formed for a clan</h2>

<p>
Clan tasks for a particular day are created in the following way for each day from the moment the task page is opened and for two weeks + 1 day ahead.
</p>

<p>
The system analyzes the list of all clans in a coordination, except for the clan for which tasks are being created. The following is filtered out from this list:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Clans that have defense planned for this day (that is, those covered or attacked by enemies)</li>
<li>Clans with a frozen SH (damaged command center or its level is lowered to 4) and clans that suspended their membership in the coordination.</li>
<li>Clans with the same defense hour as the ones covering them.</li>
<li>If a covering and/or covered clan has information about defense changes in the future, clans with an identical prime during the attack are filtered out.</li>
<li>Clans that have a planned attack at this time on this day.</li>
<li>Clans that will maintain neutrality or have a day-off on the attack day (if there is information about the change of the day-off in the future).</li>
<li>Clans that the covering clan plans to attack in the future</li>
<li>Clans that were attacked by the covering clan less than 7 days ago</li>
<li>Defenses to begin in less than 24 hours</li>
<li>Days on which the covering clan has the maximum number of battles (equal to the number of open SH directions)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tasks for different clans may differ. As more information about scheduled attacks appears on the Wargaming website and read by the clan panel, 
the completed task disappears from other clans' task lists.
